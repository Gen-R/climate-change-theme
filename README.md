# Open Science and Climate Change Theme

The theme looks at how Open Science is being used for Climate Change research.

About the [theme](https://genr.eu/wp/open-science-and-climate-change-a-genr-theme/) | See [articles](https://genr.eu/wp/category/climate-change/)

If you would like to contribute an article or help with the YouTube channel catalog please raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Gen-R/climate-change-theme/issues) or drop *GenR* a line! DM [@Gen_R_](https://twitter.com/gen_r_) or email simon@genr.eu | The *GenR* theme started in Nov 2019 and will be ongoingg in parallel with other themes.

*Generation Research* is funded by the Leibniz Association within the funding line strategic networks as part of the [Leibniz Research Alliance Open Science](https://www.leibniz-openscience.de/). *GenR* editorial büro is based at the TIB &ndash; German National Library of Science and Technology.

### YouTube &ndash; Climate Science and scientists on the platform

*GenR* carried an [interview with Joachim Allgaier](https://genr.eu/wp/youtube-fix-your-ai-for-climate-change-an-invitation-to-an-open-dialogue/) looking at the question of how YouTube is being strategically gamed to have anti-science climate denial content shown when users search for climate change subjects. 

Joachim advocated that scientists should be posting on YouTube to help push back against this trend of obscuring climate science. To answer that call *GenR* has been compiling a list of 'Top 10 Climate Change - Science - YouTube Channels'. This is our initial list and we'll keep on updating the list and sending out announcements on a regular basis. The channel list will continue to be updated as the architecture of YouTube prevents a simple catalog of channels being made publically available.

The criteria for adding channels (evolving): 1. No broadcaster channels; 2. Preferably made by scientists.

If things go well the ambition would be to build up a bigger collection.

NB: It would also be interesting to find ways for channels to identify as being Climate Change *Science* channels and be cataloged and searchavble. Please suggest ideas! So far we have:

 1. Add a tag to channels
 2. Add Crypto ID in channel description
 3. Community maintained catalog: run cataloging sessions

##### Top 10 Climate Change &mdash; Science &mdash; YouTube Channels (Dec 2019)
