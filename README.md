## Climate science media channels

### TV

### Youtube

Hot Mess - PBS https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsaEBhRsI6tmmz12fkSEYdw/featured - popular US explantory channel. Don't think that its Malthusian opener of 8 billion people, 1 planet is a useful political statement.

Our Changing Climate - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNXvxXpDJXp-mZu3pFMzYHQ - it hides the identity of the channel owners and has no references so its just not credible even though it looks interesting.
